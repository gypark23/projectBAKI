      <h1>Welcome to Eyes-Free Interactions Lab!</h1>
      <hr>
      <p>Thank you for participating in our Human Computer Interaction research project! You will be participating two 2 sets of experiments (total 4 sets).</p>
      <hr>
      <p>Here are the instructions for the two experiemnts:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Vibration-Emote Experiment
          <ol>
            <li>
              First, you will start with learning 6 different reaction emotes represented by different vibrations. Click each reaction button to learn how each reaction is represented by the vibration.
            </li>
            <li>
              Keep "learning" reactions until you are comfortable and are confident you can identify which vibration corresponds to which reaction. 
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you are comfortable, you may click proceed button to proceed into the experiment. 
            </li>
            <li>
              In the experiment, you will be given a vibration, 6 reaction buttons and a repeat vibration button. Click the reaction which you think corresponds to the given vibration. You may repeat the vibration by pressing repeat vibration button.
            </li>
            <li>
              Once you are done with the experiment, share the result page with the Project BAKI team member. 
            </li>
          </ol>
        </li>
        <li>Emote-Gesture Experiment</li>
      </ul>
